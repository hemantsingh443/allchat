## üîß Configuration

### Token Limits
The application uses dynamic token limits based on:
- **User Type**: Guest, Free, or Pro accounts
- **Model Type**: Premium models get 75% of base limits
- **Features**: Web search reduces by 20%, streaming by 10%
- **Message Length**: Longer inputs get shorter response limits
- **Special Models**: DeepSeek models get higher limits (6k-25k tokens)

### API Keys
- **OpenRouter**: Required for paid models and maximize tokens feature
- **Tavily**: Required for web search functionality
- **Google Gemini**: Used for free model access
- **Clerk**: Handles user authentication
